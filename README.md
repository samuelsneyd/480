## About

480 is a simple React web application built using TypeScript, Vite, and the Material UI component library. It is built
as a marketing and booking website for a bed and breakfast accommodation in Tutukaka, Northland, New Zealand. The
website is currently live and used in production by the client.

The live site is available at https://www.480.kiwi/

480 is hosted on GitHub Pages, and has a full CI/CD pipeline with automatic building, unit tests, and deployment from
GitHub after pushing to the production branch.

Where is the commit history? 480 was originally built as a full-stack web application with a Django backend and
PostgreSQL database in a separate repository. Due to changing requirements, it was restructured to only use the React
frontend in a separate project. This greatly simplifies the end result and better fits the client's requirements.
Unfortunately, most of the commit history is left in the previous repository.
